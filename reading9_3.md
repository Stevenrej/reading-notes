# Functional Programming Concepts

1. What is functional programming? -Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data 
2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function? - It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
It does not cause any observable side effects
3. What are the benefits of a pure function? - encourage safe ways of programming
4. What is immutability? -  an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created
5. What is Referential transparency? -  the fact that an expression, in a program, may be replaced by its value (or anything having the same value) without changing the result of the program.

2. What does the word ‘require’ do? makes sure that whatever is being imported is passed in 
3. How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in? - import
4. What do we have to do to make a module available? - Create the file that will be loaded when your module is required by another application.
