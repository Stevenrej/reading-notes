AWS EC2

1. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows you to launch virtual servers, called instances, which can be customized to your specific needs.

2.

Running web servers: EC2 instances can be used to host websites, web applications, and other web services.

Running batch jobs: EC2 instances can be used to run batch jobs that process large amounts of data or perform compute-intensive tasks.

3. ECS is a fully managed container orchestration service. This means that it handles the complexity of deploying, scaling, and managing containers for you, so you can focus on developing and running your applications.

EC2 for Humans

1. go to the main dashboard and look for the "Compute" section. Click on the "EC2" link to access the EC2 dashboard.

2.  XL instances are typically more expensive than T2 Micro instances, but they offer more consistent and higher performance.

3. A "compute cycle" refers to the processing power that is used by a computer to perform a specific task.

Elastice Beanstalk

1. Amazon Elastic Beanstalk is a fully managed service for deploying and running web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on popular infrastructure services such as Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, Amazon S3, Amazon VPC, and AWS Lambda.

2. Elastic Beanstalk is built on top of EC2 and other AWS services, and it uses EC2 instances to run your applications. When you deploy your application to Elastic Beanstalk, the service automatically creates the necessary EC2 instances and other AWS resources, such as Amazon S3 buckets and Amazon RDS databases, and configures them to host your application.

3. Cost-effective: Elastic Beanstalk allows you to pay only for the resources you consume, making it a cost-effective solution for hosting applications.

Flexible: Elastic Beanstalk supports a wide range of programming languages and frameworks, making it easy to deploy a variety of applications.

Integrated with other AWS services: Elastic Beanstalk is tightly integrated with other AWS services, such as Amazon S3 and Amazon RDS, making it easy to use these services with your application.
