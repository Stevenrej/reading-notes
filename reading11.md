# Reading Notes 11

## Video and Audio Content

1. Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s. - It much easier to embed videos since then, as well as stream videos from hosting sites.

2. Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the video element. - the src is to define where the video is being helped and the controls give you control of how the video is played

3. Why is it important to have fallback content inside the video element? - If someone needs the accessibility and or the video does not load properly

4. Write a very short story where audio and video are characters. - Without one they are not fully whole, though the video may show without audio it is just moving pictures. And though the audio may tell a story it may not portray its character. In the end, without each other, the whole story is not told.

## A Complete Guide To Grid

1. How does Grid layout differ from Flex? - Flex is about directional control while Grid does not care about the order

2. Grid container, grid item, and grid line are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences. - Grid Container
The element on which display: grid is applied. It’s the direct parent of all the grid items. In this example container is the grid container. Grid Item
The children (i.e. direct descendants) of the grid container. Here the item elements are grid items, but sub-item isn’t. Grid Line
The dividing lines that make up the structure of the grid. They can be either vertical (“column grid lines”) or horizontal (“row grid lines”) and reside on either side of a row or column. Here the yellow line is an example of a column grid line.

## Responsive Images

1. Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive? - No matter what is happening with the webpage it will always look good

2. Define the following <img> attributes srcset and sizes. Write an example of how they are used. - srcset defines the set of images we will allow the browser to choose between, and what size each image is. Each set of image information is separated from the previous one by a comma. sizes defines a set of media conditions (e.g. screen widths) and indicate what image size would be best to choose when certain media conditions are true

3. How is srcset more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript? - It's easier because its right in the HTML Rather than being on an outside page controlling the HTML
