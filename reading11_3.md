1. 
SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.
SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores. This means that SQL databases represent data in form of tables which consists of n number of rows of data whereas NoSQL databases are the collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores which do not have standard schema definitions which it needs to adhered to.
SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.
SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware. NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.
SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful. In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database.

2. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database? It is generally been stacked with apache and PHP, although it can be also stacked with nginx and server side javascripting using Node js.
3. Give a real world example. Replication: By replicating MySQL database across multiple nodes the work load can be reduced heavily increasing the scalability and availability of business application
4. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?  SQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage
5. Give a real world example. - While you can use NoSQL for transactions purpose
6. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage? NoSQL
7. Which type of database is best for scalability? SQL

What does SQL stand for? - Structured Query Language

What is a relational database? - 
What type of structure does a relational database work with? - type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another
What is a ‘schema’? - the organization or structure for a database
What is a NoSQL database? - not only SQL
How does it work? - store data in documents rather than relational tables
What is inside of a MongoDB database? - one or more collections of documents.
Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why. - MongoDB
What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database? - they don't support ACID
