# Reading Notes 6

## JavaScript object basics

1. How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with? - It is like a folder that hold all your information. The folder says who its about when you open it up you can see all the information associated with that person.

2. What are some advantages to creating object literals? - without creating writing as much code you can exact as much data as possible

3. How do objects differ from arrays? - Objects represent a special data type that is mutable and can be used to store a collection of data (rather than just a single value). Arrays are a special type of variable that is also mutable and can also be used to store a list of values.

4. Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation. - if an object property name is defined at runtime then you can't use dot notation to access the value

5. Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this? - This refers to dog

## Introduction To The DOM

1. What is the DOM? - The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

2. Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript. - The DOM is not part of the JavaScript language, but is instead a Web API used to build websites. JavaScript can also be used in other contexts. For example, Node.js runs JavaScript programs on a computer, but provides a different set of APIs, and the DOM API is not a core part of the Node.js runtime.
