## An introduction to NodeJS and Express


1. Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.


- Most time a third party from a third p[art middleware helps with certain tasks that make working in the backend much easier


2. Express the most popular __ __ ____.


- Node web framework


3. Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?


- far fewer restrictions on the best way to glue components together to achieve a goal, or even what components should be used


4. What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?


- A module is a JavaScript library/file that you can import into other code using Node's require() function.


## What is NPM?


1. What version of npm are you running on your machine?


- npm: '8.19.3'


2. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?


- npm i jshint


## What is TDD?


1. Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.


- Testing insures that when you are putting out code for publication that it is in the best working order it can be in and has been looked over to make sure there are no such errors


2. What are three expected benefits of testing


- many teams report significant reductions in defect rates, at the cost of a moderate increase in initial development effort
-the same teams tend to report that these overheads are more than offset by a reduction in effort in projects’ final phases
-although empirical research has so far failed to confirm this, veteran practitioners report that TDD leads to improved design qualities in the code, and more generally a higher degree of “internal” or technical quality, for instance improving the metrics of cohesion and coupling


3. Name at least 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.


Self
- writing too many tests at once
- writing tests that are too large or coarse-grained


Team
- partial adoption – only a few developers on the team use TDD
- poor maintenance of the test suite – most commonly leading to a test suite with a prohibitively long running time


## CI/CD


1. What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?


-Continuous integration (CI) makes software development easier, faster, and less risky for developers.


2. What is the difference between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment?


- Continuous Delivery is described as the logical evolution of continuous integration: Always be able to put a product into production!


- Continuous Deployment is described as the logical next step after continuous delivery: Automatically deploy the product into production whenever it passes QA!


3. Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background


- It gives an easy to read and understands interface that allows non-techinal users to interact on github
