# Reading Notes 3

## Learn Html

1. You would use an unordered list when making a list of items that do not necessarily need to be in order numerically

2. In CSS you can change the style of the bullet in an unordered list

3. Ordered lists should be used when needing to display items that should be ordered from most important to least while unordered lists are used for just listing.

4. You can use the type="i" to change the ordered list or you can use the start='5' to start the ordered listat a certain number

## Learn CSS

1. Once upon a time there was a context box that was all scared and alone till one day a padding box came and said it would defend the contnet and cover it from all sides not matter what. It would never allow the evil margin box to even get near it. The margin was always on the outisde and was jealous fo the content box being the center of attention but no matter how hard it tried the padding kept it at bay.

2. Content Box: Where the content is displayed, uses properties such as inline-size and block-size
Padding Box: the area that sits around the content box
Border Box: This wraps the content box as well as the padding using border related properties
Margin Box: Outermost layer that wraps everything listed before usually in white space

## Learn JavaScript

1. strings, numbers, objects, and even other arrays

2. No this is not valid because there are not valid identifiers in the array format

3. x = f() : Assignment
x += f() : Addition Assignment
x &&= f() : Logical AND Assignment
x || = f() : Logical OR Assignment
x **= f() : Exponentiation Assignment

4. The result would be 10 because that is the only number in the expression therefore the nonly output would be 10

5. if i feel tired maybe i should take a break if else i am still tired maybe i should take a nap

6. If you need to have a user complete an answer then you can use a loop to keep repateing the question until the desried outcome is inputed
