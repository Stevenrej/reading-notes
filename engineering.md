What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

- I'm not sure there is something I can bring to the table that is individually mine besides maybe my own thought process. Each person is unique in how they think and how their brain operates and I might take a different approach than someone else might. I feel like I myself have a good attitude while working, I try not to be so stressed about situations and when in situation that arises where things need to be accomplished in a timely manner I am able to block out whatever pressure and put my head down and get to work.

What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on a tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
Step away from the computer for 5-10 mins, I find it very funny how when I'm not actually in front of the computer the solution to a problem comes into my head, then I need to run back and solve it. Sometimes thinking too hard can be a disadvantage and giving yourself some space lets new ideas come to you.
Take it slow and take a good look at what I'm doing and what I have tried doing. I feel myself trying to quickly get the answer while sometimes being a bit methodical can get you a better answer in the end. 
Hit the google machine and see what comes up, even just a glimpse at some similar code can jumpstart and idea to get you to where you need to be.
