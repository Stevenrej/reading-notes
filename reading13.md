1. Why would a developer use local storage for a web application? - So when they return it will bring back whatever was used on the website previously, You also would not need to use a username because it is stored locally.

2. What information should not be stored in local storage? - Sensitive use data

3. Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing? - String type data but you can work around that with JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() methods.
