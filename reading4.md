# Reading Notes 4


## Creating Hyperlinks


1. an <a> element


2. The href contains the link to the website or site you are referencing


3. use clear link wording so it is accessible for all users


## CSS Layout


1. the way that webpage elements lay themselves out if you haven't changed their layout.


2. The size of Inline elements is just the size of their content. You can't set width or height on inline elements, they just sit inside the content of block-level elements while block elements are able to be moved


3. Static positioning


4. with absolute positioning you can place an element wherever you would like on the page regardless of other elements on the page


5. whereas absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one), fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport


## Functions


1. declaring a function would be putting let before and invoking by including the name of the function in the code somewhere, followed by parentheses.


2. Function parameters are values that need to be included inside the function parentheses while arguments are essentially the same thing


## Pair Programming


1.
Listening: hearing and interpreting the vocabulary
Speaking: using the correct words to communicate an idea
Reading: understanding what written language intends to convey
Writing: producing from scratch a meaningful, well-structured solution
